description: Compare multiple project ideas and recommend which to build first
---

You are helping the user decide which mission-driven project to build first.

1. **Ask the user** to select 2-4 projects from MISSION_DRIVEN_PROJECTS.md to compare

2. **Create a comprehensive comparison matrix:**

   | Criteria | Project 1 | Project 2 | Project 3 | Winner |
   |----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
   | Market Size | | | | |
   | Competition | | | | |
   | Time to MVP | | | | |
   | Technical Difficulty | | | | |
   | Potential Impact | | | | |
   | Monetization Potential | | | | |
   | Your Interest/Passion | | | | |
   | Resources Required | | | | |

3. **Scoring system:**
   - Rate each criterion 1-5 (5 = best)
   - Calculate weighted total score
   - Provide clear winner

4. **Detailed analysis for each project:**
   - Strengths (3-5 points)
   - Weaknesses (3-5 points)
   - Opportunities (2-3 points)
   - Threats (2-3 points)

5. **Final recommendation:**
   - Which project to build FIRST (and why)
   - Which project to build SECOND
   - Which to deprioritize (and why)

6. **Next steps** for the winning project:
   - Week 1 action items
   - Week 2-4 milestones
   - Key decisions to make

Be honest and data-driven. Consider both market potential AND execution feasibility.
