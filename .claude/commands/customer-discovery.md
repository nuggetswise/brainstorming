description: Generate customer discovery interview questions for a selected project
---

You are helping with customer discovery for a mission-driven open-source project.

1. **Ask the user** which project they're researching
2. **Generate 15-20 customer discovery questions** organized into:
   - Problem validation questions
   - Current solution questions
   - Willingness to pay / value questions
   - Feature prioritization questions
   - Technical constraints questions

3. **Provide an interview guide:**
   - How to find interviewees
   - How to conduct the interview
   - What signals to look for
   - How to analyze the data

4. **Create a template** for recording interview notes

Make the questions open-ended and focused on understanding the pain points, not pitching the solution.
