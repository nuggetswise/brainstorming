description: Generate detailed MVP specification for a selected project
---

You are creating a detailed MVP specification document for a mission-driven open-source project.

1. **Ask which project** from MISSION_DRIVEN_PROJECTS.md to spec out

2. **Create a comprehensive MVP spec including:**
   - **Problem Statement** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - **Solution Overview** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - **User Stories** (10-15 key user stories)
   - **Feature Requirements** (must-have vs nice-to-have)
   - **Technical Architecture**
     - System diagram
     - Database schema
     - API endpoints
     - AI integration points
   - **Non-Functional Requirements**
     - Performance
     - Security
     - Scalability
   - **Success Metrics** (how to measure if MVP is successful)
   - **Out of Scope** (what we're explicitly NOT building)

3. **Provide implementation guidance:**
   - Development phases (week by week)
   - Testing strategy
   - Deployment plan

4. **Save the spec** to a new file: `SPEC_[PROJECT_NAME].md`

Make it detailed enough for a developer to start coding immediately.
