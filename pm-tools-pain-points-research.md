- **Pro:** $59/maker/month (annually) = $708/year
- **Enterprise:** $300-400/maker/month = $3,600-4,800/year
  - Enterprise quotes: $70,000-100,000/year for 20 users

### Top 3 Pain Points

#### 1. PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE FOR SMALL TEAMS
**Real User Complaints:**
- "The pricing may be slightly on the higher end for smaller teams or startups" (G2 Review, 2025)
- Enterprise pricing of $300-400/maker/month makes it accessible only to well-funded organizations
- "Both [Productboard and Aha!] are complicated and quite expensive" (comparison review, 2025)

**Impact:** Small product teams and startups are priced out of professional roadmapping tools entirely.

#### 2. PERFORMANCE ISSUES
**Real User Complaints:**
- Users "complain about performance and some interface elements" (2024 review)
- Issues with efficiency, especially during onboarding process
- Has "been an issue in funding conversations" for teams trying to justify costs

**Impact:** Teams pay premium prices but experience slow, frustrating software that impacts productivity.

#### 3. COMPLEX FEATURE OVERLOAD
**Real User Complaints:**
- "One of the most common complaints about Productboard is that it can just be too much"
- The complexity makes onboarding difficult and prolongs time-to-value
- Users struggle to extract value relative to the high cost

**Impact:** Teams spend weeks learning the tool instead of doing product work.

### Open Source Opportunity

**What Open Source Could Do Better:**
- **Transparent, affordable pricing:** Self-hosted option with optional cloud hosting at 1/10th the cost
- **Simplified core feature set:** Focus on essential roadmapping, feedback collection, and prioritization without bloat
- **Fast, lightweight architecture:** Built with modern tech stack optimized for speed

## 2. AHA!

### Overview
Comprehensive product management suite with roadmaps, strategy, and idea management.

### Pricing (2025)
- **Premium:** $59/user/month (annually) = $708/year
- **Enterprise:** $99/user/month (annually) = $1,188/year
- **Enterprise+:** $149/user/month (annually) = $1,788/year

**Note:** Annual commitment required, no monthly billing flexibility.

### Top 3 Pain Points

#### 1. EXTREMELY HIGH COST BARRIERS
**Real User Complaints:**
- "Nearly 100% of users who mentioned cost reported that Aha!'s offerings were too expensive for smaller businesses"
- "It's hard to justify paying $74/user/mo just for feedback boards or $124/user/mo for roadmapping"
- "The cost of a license is not cheap, and it took my business a long time to convince senior executives to allow us to get the Ideas Advanced licensing"
- "Their expensive pricing and outdated products make them unideal for smaller and medium-sized companies"

**Impact:** Only large enterprises with substantial budgets can afford Aha!, excluding 90% of product teams.

#### 2. CONFUSING, RESTRICTIVE PRICING MODEL
**Real User Complaints:**
- "Aha!'s pricing model can be confusing to users at first—especially if you want to opt in to more than one of their products"
- "The need to commit to a full year of license costs can be restrictive, and the pricing is not dynamic enough"
- "Some users report high costs hinder wider adoption"
- "Seat-based licensing model and the high cost per user prevent wider adoption within organizations"

**Impact:** Teams can't scale adoption organically, forcing "all or nothing" licensing decisions.

#### 3. FEATURE BLOAT AND STEEP LEARNING CURVE
**Real User Complaints:**
- Users "complain about missing features, price, and a steep learning curve"
- "Some users feel that more isn't always better. The sheer number of features can sometimes make the tool feel bloated and overwhelming"
- Too many separate products (Roadmaps, Ideas, Whiteboards, etc.) creates confusion

**Impact:** Teams pay for features they'll never use while struggling to learn what they actually need.

### Open Source Opportunity

**What Open Source Could Do Better:**
- **Modular architecture:** Install only what you need (roadmaps, feedback, strategy docs) rather than bundled suite
- **No annual lock-in:** Use it as long as it's valuable, stop when it's not
- **Community pricing:** Free self-hosted, pay-what-you-can for managed hosting
- **Simplified UI/UX:** Focus on 80% use cases that matter, skip enterprise bloat
- **Better integrations:** Built on APIs-first architecture with pre-built connectors
- **Progressive disclosure:** Start simple, reveal advanced features as users grow

**Example Tools:** Taiga (agile/roadmaps), Plane (issues/roadmaps), OpenProject

**Real User Complaints:**
- "Atlassian DC prices are going up...new prices going into effect for renewals on or after Feb. 15, 2025"
- "Told in October 2024 prices would increase 5-10%, but the actual increases were much larger" - described as "highway robbery"
- "Jira cloud plans will rise by 5 to 20 percent" starting October 2025
- "Atlassian's pricing got insane when they discontinued Server editions and began forcing users to Datacenter/Cloud"

**Impact:** Teams face 10-20% annual increases with no way to escape, forcing budget reallocations.

#### 2. EXTREME COMPLEXITY AND STEEP LEARNING CURVE
**Real User Complaints:**
- "Jira came in 1st place as the most hated tool in 'the pragmatic engineer' survey for 2025"
- "The learning curve is steep for regular users, and for admin users 'it's really difficult to find their way in the application'"
- "Spiked learning curve, especially for new users and the non technical team members"
- "JIRA 'still is unable to please the broader audience due to its complexity and steep learning curve'"
- "Has a steep learning curve with 'a ton of features, with many of them that will never be used by an average business'"
- Reviews call JIRA "complicated," "cluttered," with "parts of the interface being difficult to understand"

**Impact:** Teams lose weeks of productivity during onboarding; non-technical users avoid the tool.

#### 3. FORCED BLOAT AND ENTERPRISE FEATURES
**Real User Complaints:**
- "JIRA has been 'forced to bloat the product' by appealing to enterprises"
- "Small teams feel it's overkill and they're paying way too much"
- "For large organizations, 'you are also looking at a crazy per user cost'"
- Atlassian's licensing model often is an "everyone or no one" model
- "It is expensive just keeps adding up depends on the features you need"

**Impact:** Small teams pay for and must navigate enterprise features they'll never use.

### Open Source Opportunity

**What Open Source Could Do Better:**
- **Lightweight by default:** Start with clean, simple issue tracking - add complexity only when needed

- **Enterprise:** Custom pricing (minimum 5 seats)
- **Enterprise+:** Custom pricing (minimum 10 seats)

### Top 3 Pain Points

#### 1. HIDDEN MINIMUM SEAT REQUIREMENTS
**Real User Complaints:**
- "Asana requires customers to pay for at least two seats without clear notice, even for individual users"
- "All paid plans mandate minimum seat purchases: Starter requires 2 seats minimum, while subsequent tiers require 3+, 4+, and 5+ seats"
- "Users must pay for 10 users even when they just need to add their sixth user"
- "The lack of transparency about minimum seat requirements can lead to unexpected costs and budget overruns"
- Makes Asana "one of the most expensive on the market"

**Impact:** Hidden costs create budget surprises, and teams overpay for unused seats.

#### 2. AGGRESSIVE FEATURE GATING
**Real User Complaints:**
- "Key features for effective project management, such as advanced customization and portfolio management, are restricted to higher-tier plans that require a minimum of 4 seats"
- Asana "tucks one or two must-have business features into a higher, more expensive tier" to force upgrades
- "Raised their prices and taken away a lot of features for free users to force you to pay"
- For Enterprise plans, "there's no transparent pricing and it's impossible to know the cost without a sales call"

**Impact:** Teams are forced into expensive tiers to access basic features like portfolios and custom fields.

#### 3. PERCEIVED AS EXPENSIVE FOR VALUE
**Real User Complaints:**
- "Reviewers think Asana is relatively expensive and works better for companies with deep pockets"
- Forum post titled: "Asana pricing is unfair and takes advantage of its customers"
- Users feel they're paying premium prices for standard project management features

- **Organization:** $45/editor/month (annually) = $540/year (22% increase)
- **Enterprise:** $75/editor/month (annually) = $900/year

**Note:** Dev Mode is now paid (added Jan 2024), dramatically increasing costs for engineering teams.

### Top 3 Pain Points

#### 1. STEEP PRICE INCREASES (22-25% IN 2024)
**Real User Complaints:**
- "22% increase for some plans" described as "particularly controversial"
- Reddit: "Every software company does this. Gather critical mass through a free plan, lock in consumers, and raise the prices more and more"
- Reddit: "I love Figma, but holy shit does their pricing strategy suck"
- "For smaller teams and freelancers, the increase feels like a slap - a 22% hike for tools already in use without significant immediate boost in functionality"

**Impact:** Established users feel trapped and taken advantage of after years of loyalty.

#### 2. DEV MODE PRICING TRAP
**Real User Complaints:**
- "Dev Mode became a paid feature in January 2024"
- "Since teams usually consist of more developers than designers, this quickly increases the price for Figma seats"
- "The licensing for developers seems excessive, almost forcing developers to buy a license"
- Causing designers to "consider switching to other tools like Penpot and Adobe XD"

**Impact:** Total team costs explode when adding developers, multiplying the per-seat expense.

#### 3. CONFUSING BILLING AND ACCIDENTAL CHARGES
**Real User Complaints:**
- "Paying $300 in a month just because they enabled a few client accounts to edit for one day and forgot to change permissions back to viewer"
- "Price changes especially affect freelancers, as they need to book additional seats for each client they work with"
- Hidden collaboration costs when external stakeholders need temporary access

**Impact:** Unpredictable bills and billing anxiety create friction in client collaboration.

### Open Source Opportunity

**What Open Source Could Do Better:**
- **No price increases:** Self-host or use community-hosted version, costs stay flat
- **Free dev mode:** Developers should be able to inspect designs without licensing fees
- **Transparent collaboration:** Guest access without surprise billing

- **Business:** $20/member/month (annually) = $240/year
- **Enterprise:** Custom pricing (volume-based)

### Top 3 Pain Points

#### 1. EXPENSIVE FOR REGULAR USE
**Real User Complaints:**
- "Miro is superior to these tools, but it is also significantly expensive"
- "Paid plans can be expensive"
- "The only downside for me was the price, it's a bit on the expensive side"
- Some users find cost "reasonable" only "considering the number of projects," implying heavy usage is needed to justify it

**Impact:** Teams must constantly evaluate if whiteboarding justifies the recurring cost.

#### 2. AGGRESSIVE FREE PLAN DEGRADATION
**Real User Complaints:**
- "Miro is actively starving those plans out by reducing the functionality of them to the point they become unusable, essentially forcing people to change to a more expensive plan"
- "Confusing pricing and frustrating free version limitations"
- "People without full license have limited options to collaborate (only comments)"

**Impact:** Users feel manipulated into paying through artificial free tier restrictions.

#### 3. INFLEXIBLE LICENSING FOR COLLABORATORS
**Real User Complaints:**
- "I wish we could buy them a temporary 'two hour license' to enable them for that particular event"
- External collaborators need full licenses even for brief participation
- No flexible guest access model for workshops or client sessions

**Impact:** Teams overspend on licenses for occasional participants or exclude them entirely.

### Open Source Opportunity

## CROSS-CUTTING THEMES: TOP 5 SYSTEMIC ISSUES

### 1. PRICING PAIN POINTS

**Common Patterns:**
- **Seat-based pricing traps:** Minimum seat requirements (Asana, Productboard, Aha!)
- **Annual commitments:** No monthly flexibility (Aha!, most enterprise tiers)
- **Aggressive increases:** 5-80% price hikes in 2024-2025 across all tools
- **Hidden costs:** Dev Mode (Figma), minimum seats (Asana), Data Center migrations (JIRA)
- **Enterprise opacity:** "Contact sales" for pricing creates friction and distrust

**What Makes Them Prohibitively Expensive:**
- Forced bundles of features users don't need
- Minimum seat requirements that exceed small team sizes
- Annual-only billing that prevents month-to-month testing
- Per-user costs that make company-wide adoption impossibly expensive

**Open Source Solution:**
- Self-hosting option (pay only infrastructure costs)
- Optional managed hosting at 1/10th proprietary cost
- Pay-per-instance, not per-user
- Transparent pricing, no sales calls required
- No forced annual commitments

---

### 2. MISSING FEATURES & FEATURE GATING

**Common Patterns:**
- **Essential features in expensive tiers:** Portfolios, custom fields, automation locked behind $25+/user plans
- **Missing integrations:** Tools don't connect with each other well (Productboard-Jira sync issues, Aha! Power BI gaps)
- **No customization:** Rigid workflows that don't match team processes
- **Poor reporting:** Limited analytics and insights without enterprise tier

**What Users Wish Existed:**
- **Bi-directional sync:** Real-time updates between roadmap and dev tools
- **Better reporting:** Built-in analytics without expensive enterprise upgrades
- **Flexible workflows:** Customize to team needs without admin complexity
- **AI assistance:** Smart prioritization and summarization (not $20/month add-ons)
- **Better search:** Find anything across all tools instantly

**Open Source Solution:**
- All features available to all users—no artificial gating
- Plugin architecture for community-contributed features

---

### 3. COMPLEXITY & LEARNING CURVE

**Common Patterns:**
- **Steep onboarding:** 1-2 weeks to productivity (JIRA, Aha!)
- **Bloated interfaces:** Too many features, overwhelming navigation
- **Poor documentation:** Enterprise features under-documented
- **Admin complexity:** Requires dedicated admin training

**Real Impact:**
- Lost productivity during onboarding
- Low adoption across non-technical teams
- Dependency on "power users" who understand the tool
- Abandoned features due to complexity

**Open Source Solution:**
- **Progressive disclosure:** Simple by default, power features when needed
- **Better onboarding:** Interactive tutorials, contextual help
- **Modern UX:** Clean interfaces inspired by Linear, Notion
- **Community documentation:** Real examples, templates, best practices
- **Opinionated defaults:** Works well out-of-box, customizable later

---

### 4. INTEGRATION PROBLEMS

**Common Patterns:**
- **One-way sync:** Updates flow only one direction (Aha! → JIRA but not back)
- **Manual workarounds:** Zapier required for basic connections
- **Data inconsistency:** Different tools show different "truth"
- **Missing connectors:** No Power BI, no Slack, no GitHub integrations
- **Proprietary APIs:** Rate limits, poor documentation, breaking changes

**Real Impact:**
- Duplicate work across multiple tools
- Data becomes stale and unreliable
- Teams resort to spreadsheets to bridge gaps
- Integration maintenance becomes a full-time job

**Open Source Solution:**
- **API-first architecture:** Everything accessible via clean, documented APIs
- **Webhooks everywhere:** Real-time event streaming
- **Standard protocols:** Use OAuth, GraphQL, REST—no proprietary formats
- **Community integrations:** Open plugin marketplace
- **Bi-directional sync:** Real-time updates in both directions
- **Open data formats:** JSON, CSV, standard schemas

---

### 5. VENDOR LOCK-IN CONCERNS

**Common Patterns:**
- **Proprietary formats:** Can't easily export complete data (Figma, Productboard)
- **Migration difficulty:** "Too overwhelming to tackle" (JIRA migration)
- **Broken exports:** Data export doesn't include everything or is corrupted
- **Integration dependencies:** Entire workflow built around one vendor
- **Switching costs:** Months of work to migrate to alternative

**Real Impact:**
- Teams feel trapped in expensive tools they dislike
- Can't negotiate better pricing (vendor has leverage)
- Fear of losing historical data prevents exploration
- Sunken cost fallacy keeps teams stuck

**Open Source Solution:**
- **Open data formats:** SQLite, PostgreSQL, JSON, CSV
- **Complete export:** One-click export of all data, attachments, history
- **Import tools:** Easy migration from JIRA, Asana, etc.
- **Self-hosted data:** You own the database, full control
- **No vendor dependency:** Fork the project if needed
- **Regular export testing:** Verify data portability quarterly
