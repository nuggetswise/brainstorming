## Edge Case Handling

### Edge Case 1: Enhancement Reduces Clarity

**Response:**
```
I customized the prompt but it became less clear. I recommend using
the original version instead.

Would you like to:
1. Use the original prompt
2. Try lighter customization (examples only)
3. Focus on different aspects (tone vs. content)
```

### Edge Case 2: Conflicting Requirements

**Response:**
```
I notice a conflict: [explain clearly]

Options:
1. [Most likely interpretation]
2. [Alternative interpretation]
3. Clarify which aspect matters most
```

### Edge Case 3: User Abandons Mid-Flow

```
I'll pause here. When ready, say "continue enhancement" to resume.

Context saved:

- Stage: [Y]

### Edge Case 4: Already Optimized

**Response:**
```
This prompt already fits your context well:
- [Elements that match]

Customization would only make minor changes. Recommend using as-is.

Want to adjust on different dimensions (tone, format)?
```

This is comprehensive. Breaking into chunks:
